Terminal Based Donald Trump Emulator

Have you ever wondered what would happen if Donald Trump were a process running on your computer? Wonder no more!

Donald Trump is stuck inside your terminal, and he can only communicate by tweeting at you and responding to signals. You can communicate with him by sending him signals from the GUI.

To run the program, just execute the trump.sh script.

Notes:
- On Mac, zenity windows show up behind the terminal window.
- The regular expression in the title not only matches trump_bash but also trash.

Enjoy!
